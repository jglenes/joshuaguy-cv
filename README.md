# Curriculum Vitae
---
This is a repository for my academic CV.  The purpose of this project was to learn how to:

1. Design an attractive and contemporary CV in LaTeX.
1. Maintain a repository to track changes over time to my CV.

## Requirements

* [XeTeX/XeLaTeX](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex): When compiling this document, don't use pdfLaTeX -- it won't work. I'm using custom fonts throughout the document, which aren't supported (very well) by pdfLaTeX.
* [Lato (Google Web Font)](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato)
* [Lora (Google Web Font)](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora)

## Credits

* [How to write a LaTeX class file and design your own CV (Part 1)](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2011/03/27/how-to-write-a-latex-class-file-and-design-your-own-cv.html#.UbjGn_ZASgQ): Inspiration for this project.
* [Creating a Curriculum Vit√¶ with LaTeX & the CurVe Document Class](http://text-ex-machina.co.uk/blog/creating-curriculum-vit)
