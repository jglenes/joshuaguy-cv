# Curriculum Vitae
---
This is a repository for my academic CV.  The purpose of this project was to learn:

1. How to create a custom `\documentclass{}` for a CV.
1. Design an attractive and contemporary CV in LaTeX.
1. Maintain a repository to track changes over time to my CV.

## Requirements

* [XeTeX/XeLaTeX](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex): When compiling this document, dont' use pdfLaTeX -- it won't work. I'm using custom fonts throughout the document, which aren't supported (very well) by pdfLaTeX.

## Credits

* [How to write a LaTeX class file and design your own CV (Part 1)](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2011/03/27/how-to-write-a-latex-class-file-and-design-your-own-cv.html#.UbjGn_ZASgQ): Inspiration for this project.
